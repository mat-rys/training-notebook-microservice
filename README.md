## **üß© Important Functionalities utilized in the Project**
* **Multi-threaded Routing API Gateway**: Distributes traffic across user services with multi-threaded routing capabilities.
* **Security Provided by External Tool Keycloak**: Ensures robust security, particularly beneficial for larger applications like microservices.
* **External Security Does Not Constrain Us During Component Operations**: External security measures do not limit our ability to operate any component.
* **Service Segmentation Allows Project to Function Despite Certain Components Being Non-Operational**: Division into services enables the project to continue functioning even if specific elements are non-operational.

## **üîí Security**
* The project utilizes an authentication token that does not contain sensitive data.
* It employs the external tool Keycloak for authorization.
* The API gateway is open to requests, however, access to each service is not provided without authentication.
* Tokens are established in Keycloak, for example, temporally or based on scopes.
